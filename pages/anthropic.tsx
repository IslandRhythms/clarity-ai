              The landscape of artificial intelligence is being revolutionized not just by more powerful models, but by dramatic improvements in inference speed. These advances are unlocking new possibilities in real-time applications, particularly in multimodal AI systems that can process video, audio, and sensor data simultaneously.

              What makes these recent advances particularly significant is not just the raw processing speed, but the ability to run sophisticated neural networks on edge devices. This distributed computing approach enables applications like real-time video monitoring, automated quality control in manufacturing, and intelligent traffic management systems - all while maintaining data privacy and reducing latency.
